    /* Session API */

    /*! \brief Creates a new session.
     *
     *  Connections of a client to a Simutrace storage server are represented
     *  as a session. This method connects to the specified server and creates
     *  a new local session as well as a new session on the server side.
     *  Calling this function is the first step, when working with Simutrace.
     *  To successfully establish a connection, the server process must already
     *  be running and accept connections on the address specified by @p server.
     *
     *  \param server Specifies the connection string used to contact the
     *                server. The specifier must be supplied in the form
     *                <tt>channel:address</tt>. Supported specifiers are:
     *                - <tt>local:pipe</tt> (recommended)
     *
     *                  The server runs on the same host as the client.
     *                  This is the fastest connection with a Simutrace server,
     *                  because the server and client can use shared memory
     *                  to communicate trace data. To exchange commands a
     *                  named pipe is utilized. The named pipe must be set
     *                  in the server configuration and will be created by the
     *                  server at startup.
     *
     *                  Example connecting through a named pipe to a server
     *                  running on the same host. On Windows, the "\\.\Pipe\"-
     *                  prefix must be omitted.
     *                  \code
     *                  local:/tmp/mypipe
     *                  \endcode
     *
     *                - <tt>socket:ipv4|[ipv6]|dns:port</tt>
     *
     *                  The server runs on a remote host. This channel will
     *                  use a regular TCP/IP connection. The remote host
     *                  may be specified through its IPv4, IPv6 or its dns
     *                  name. Since Simutrace does not have a default port,
     *                  the address must always include the destination port.
     *                  The socket connection can also be used to connect to
     *                  a local server, however in that case a local channel
     *                  connection is recommended to improve performance.
     *
     *                  Examples connecting through a TCP socket to a server
     *                  running on the same or a remote host.
     *                  \code
     *                  socket:10.1.1.10:7000
     *                  socket:simutrace.org:7000
     *                  socket:[2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329]:7000
     *                  \endcode
     *
     *                  When setting up a socket binding in the server the
     *                  binding string may also contain a "*"-wildcard for (a)
     *                  the interface address to denote all installed
     *                  interfaces, and (b) for the port number to let the
     *                  operating system choose a port. However, keep in mind
     *                  that you need to specify the exact address and port on
     *                  the client. Examples:
     *                  \code
     *                  socket:*:7000
     *                  socket:*:*
     *                  socket:10.1.1.10:*
     *                  \endcode
     *
     *  \returns A #SessionId, identifying the newly created session if
     *           successful, \c INVALID_SESSION_ID otherwise.
     *           For a more detailed error description call StGetLastError().
     *
     *  \remarks The connection to the server is established by the thread
     *           calling StSessionCreate(). Only the very same thread is able
     *           to work with the session. To connect further threads to a
     *           session call StSessionOpen() from within the respective
     *           threads that should participate in the tracing session.
     *
     *  \remarks Before a thread connected to a Simutrace server exits,
     *           it must release its connection. For more details see
     *           StSessionClose().

     *
     *                     Simutrace's native storage format (v 3.0). It
     *                     fully supports all features, provides fast access
     *                     even for very large traces and comes with a
     *                     built-in aggressive but fast compressor for memory
     *                     traces (see StStreamFindMemoryType()).
     *
     *                     The \c simtrace storage back-end saves trace data
     *                     in a regular file on disk. The path can be

     *                     The \c simtrace storage format uses the extension
     *                     \c sim. Although a trace can have any valid file
     *                     name, enumerating \c simtrace stores will list only

     *  This method reads variable-sized data from the supplied stream given
     *  a reference, originally returned by StWriteVariableData().
     *
     *  \param handlePtr Pointer to a read handle for the stream that stores
     *                   the variable-sized data.
     *
     *  \param reference Reference to the variable-sized data in the given
     *                   stream.
     *
     *  \param destinationBuffer Pointer to a buffer receiving the
     *                           variable-sized data. The buffer needs to
     *                           provide enough space. Supply \c NULL to
     *                           determine the length of the data.
     *
     *  \returns The length of the referenced variable-sized data in bytes, if
     *           successful, \c -1 otherwise. For a more detailed error
     *           description call StGetLastError().
