    /* Stream Multiplexer */

    /*! \brief Creates a new stream multiplexer
     *
     *  A stream multiplexer chooses the next entry from a set of input
     *  streams based on a defined rule. The multiplexer is accessed like a
     *  regular stream.
     *
     *  \param session The session for which the multiplexer should be created.
     *
     *  \param name A friendly name for the multiplexer.
     *
     *  \param rule The multiplexing rule, which determines the next entry.
     *
     *  \param flags A set of flags to customize multiplexing behavior.
     *
     *  \param inputStreams Pointer to an array of streams that should be
     *                      used as input for the multiplexer.
     *
     *  \param count The number of elements in the \p inputStreams array.
     *
     *  \returns The id the dynamic stream representing the created multiplexer.
     *           Read entries from the multiplexer by reading entries from the
     *           stream with the returned id. The id is INVALID_STREAM_ID on
     *           error. For a more detailed error description call
     *           StGetLastError().
     *
     *  \remarks The multiplexer will only be visible in the same session
     *           for the client that created the multiplexer.
